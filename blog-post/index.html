<h3>What is the difference fixed, fluid, adaptive and responsive, and what are the benefits of each</h3>
<body><p>Fixed websites have a set width, resizing the browser window or viewing it on a different device wont affect on the way the website looks.</p>
<p>Fluid websites are built using percentages for widths. As a result, columns are relative to one another and the browser allowing it to scale up and down fluidly.</p>
<p>Adaptive websites introduce media queries to target specific device sizes, like smaller monitors, tablets, and mobile.</p>
<p>Responsive websites are built on a fluid grid and use media queries to control the design and its content as it scales down or up with the browser or device.</p></body>
