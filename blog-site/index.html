<h3>What is the difference fixed, fluid, adaptive and responsive, and what are the benefits of each</h3>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<p>Fixed websites have a set width, resizing the browser window or viewing it on a different device wont affect on the way the website looks. Fixed width design allowed designers great amounts of control over layout, typography and other graphic elements. This allowed designers to think about web pages as static pages similar to pages found in a magazine. It led to some beautiful designs that looked great at very specific screen sizes.</p>
<h3>Fluid</h3>
<p>Fluid websites are built using percentages for widths. As a result, columns are relative to one another and the browser allowing it to scale up and down fluidly. The web, by nature, is fluid. HTML, without applied CSS, will flow to be 100% of the width of the pages body. As a browser window shrinks, text adjusts. Fluid Design embraced this fluidity before Responsive Design was even a possibility.</p>
<h3>Adaptive</h3>
<p>Adaptive websites introduce media queries to target specific device sizes, like smaller monitors, tablets, and mobile.Adaptive Design will serve different versions of the site to different devices based on common screen sizes and resolutions. This approach is considered less future-proof than responsive design because the screen sizes of common devices are constantly changing.</p>
<h3>Responsive</h3>
<p>Responsive websites are built on a fluid grid and use media queries to control the design and its content as it scales down or up with the browser or device. Rather than setting breakpoints at common screen sizes (like adaptive design), Responsive design makes decisions based on the needs of the content.</p>
<p>Web designers will often grow and shrink their browser windows to analyze type, margins, padding, line-height, and other layout considerations. When a line of text or an image is uncomfortably squished or has too much space, a breakpoint will be added via a CSS media query. The text, image or layout will change size based on the needs of the content.</p> 
<p>Responsive design also uses flexible images so that images scale depending on the width of the browser window or device.</p>
